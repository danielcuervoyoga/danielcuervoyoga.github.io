							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>
								Hi, I’m Daniel Cuervo, a passionate yoga teacher from Colombia. My yoga journey began with a spark of curiosity and quickly grew into a deep and lifelong passion. After completing my foundational Vinyasa training at Awakening Yoga Academy with Patrick Beach and Carling Harps, I embraced teaching as my path and have been dedicated to guiding others ever since.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’ve since deepened my knowledge with an additional 100 hours in Hatha yoga, mobility, and body mechanics, earning my 300-hour certification. My teaching style is rooted in creative sequencing, combining strength, mindfulness, and mobility to create well-rounded classes. I believe yoga is for everyone, regardless of where they start. My classes are designed to meet students where they are, building strength and intuition while embracing each person’s unique limitations.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m passionate about creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable and supported, no matter their experience level. My goal is for you to leave each practice feeling more connected, balanced, present, and truly happy in your body.
							</p>
							<p>
								Join me on the mat, and let’s explore the beautiful synergy of mind, body, and spirit together.
